      <p>Stray animals do not have any human caring for them nor housing them.<br>
        They live and feed on the streets and may be adopted by a lucky human.<br>
        Most of the time, strays may die without getting a home, or they may end up in an animal shelter when spotted by
        animal control.<br>
        Many animals end up as strays because they were abandoned by their owners, or they were excess kittens or
        puppies from multiple births.<br>
        Sometimes, pets that get missing and have no form of identifications also end up as strays.</p>

        <h2>Stray Dogs</h2>
        <p>Stray dogs are homeless canines. They are often unconfined, and mostly, they are found in the cities. They
          get birthed, live, and die on the streets. They spend most of their days wandering through the streets and
          looking for food. Scientifically, they are known as free-ranging animals. Because of the hustle and bustle of
          cities, stray dogs need intelligence and adaptability to survive. The street is an upgrade of the wilderness
          for the dogs where they face extreme weather conditions, lack of food, and zero veterinarian care.</p>

        <h2>Stray Cows</h2>
        <p>Stray cows or stray cattle are animals such as cows, bulls, oxen and buffaloes that roam freely. A cow is
          considered "stray" when its owner no longer claims ownership or its owner cannot be determined.
          Cow slaughter is banned in many places in India with penalties of long imprisonment and huge fines. Fear of
          arrest, persecution, and lynching by cow vigilantes has reduced the trading of cows. Once a cow stops giving
          milk, feeding and maintenance of the cow becomes a financial burden on the farmer who cannot afford their
          upkeep.</p>

        <h2>Stray Cats</h2>
        <p></p>A feral cat is typically born in the wild or outdoors with little to no human interaction. If you attempt
        to get too close or try to pet them, feral cats view your hand as a claw that will harm them and will hiss
        and/or run away. Feral cats are born from other ferals or from stray cats. What is the difference between the
        two? Well, a stray cat was once a pet cat, until it was either lost or was abandoned by its owner. While they
        struggle to survive in their new outdoor environment, some strays become fearful of people, even adopting feral
        behaviors after a period of time, depending on their surroundings. However, most stray cats remember that humans
        feed them and try to stay near homes, carports, and other areas where people concentrate.</p>

        <div class="img"><img src="images/cats1.jpg" height="200" width="300"></div>
        <p>There should be no stray animals. The phrase “stray animals” nearly always refers to stray cats and dogs.
          Stray cats and dogs are domestic animals which have strayed from their home where they were cared for by a
          person or persons. When a person takes it upon himself to look after a cat or dog the responsibility includes
          ensuring that their pet does not stray from their home. This is probably obvious but it needs to be stated
          because it tells us that the reason for the existence of stray animals is the failure of some people to look
          after their pet properly. Either that is the reason or the domestication of the cat has failed. If cats want
          to leave the safety of their human's home something is wrong. </p>
